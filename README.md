# Project Overview

I completed this project as part of CS 372 (Intro to Computer Networks) during Winter 2020 while I was a student at Oregon State University. **Students in that class were granted express permission to post the source code they submitted for this project publicly for use in professional portfolios.**

This project implements a simple Linux-based file transfer system that uses web sockets. The client program was coded in Python 3, and the server was coded in C (C99 with GNU extensions, compiled with the GCC compiler). When the server program is running, the client program allows the listing of all files in the current directory, the listing of all .txt files in the current directory, and the fetching of the contents of a particular file. 

# Repository Structure

The source code for both the client and server is located in the src/ folder. **All files in the src/ directory have not been modified since being submitted as part of this course assignment.** For more details about how to interact with this program, please see [the original README file in the src/ repository](src/README.txt) that was submitted as part of this course assignment.
